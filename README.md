Things I Would have done if i had a bit more time -

I would have structures my project better
I would have more seperations of concerns!
I'd have model view controllers 

I'd impliment on the front end side - a way to change cities and then save those cities which the app already does if it could get different cities 

I'd also make a caching system on the backend side!

# I dediced to send this in earlier to not go over limit!
# Thank you!
